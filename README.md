# ESA-ESRIN_Mosaic_Catalog

This repository contains the code for creating a mosaic catalog of the hyperspectral 2018 FLEX campaign data developed during my Young Graduate Trainee program at ESA-ESRIN. It was published with permission from my supervisor.

The mosaic catalog visualizes an overview map, a True Color Image (TCI) and information of each mosaic on the harddrive with the 2018 FLEX campaign data.
These include mosaics generated by the FLEX campaign team and those generated by me using the Mosaicking routine in the ESA-ESRIN_Mosaicking repository. In total, the catalog contains 21 mosaics. The aim of the catalog is to provide a quick overview over the available data for future validations of optical data.

The code ingests a manually created csv input file provided in the input folder and outputs the catalog overview pages for each mosaic in the output folder. Here, a text file listing all output file replaces the actual results and a sample file illustrates a catalog overview page. The Mosaic_Catalog_Presentation folder contains the LaTex code that puts the overview of each mosaic together into a presentation. Due to the file size, the PDF is not provided.
